It takes a long time for you to realize that you truly are the same person as your birth mother.\n",

It is just the reality that is happening right now.\n",

      "I have a friend who has a very deep emotional problem. He is very sensitive, and has a very strong sense of humor. He sometimes has the thought to write about his experience of depression or anxiety. I feel sorry for him. He has been depressed for so long and is experiencing severe depression, with no cure, for the past 12 years. He has been told to leave the depression by someone. He has found someone to talk to. He has also been told that he is not good enough for everyone else and needs a lot of help. He is not alone. He has had friends and loved ones in the past who have had the same experience, and who have had the same result. I have also heard a lot of people say that they will do anything to help him. His friends in the community have told him that they will help him if he goes through this. They have told him that they will go to the local hospital to help him if he goes through this. They have told him that they will help him if he goes to the doctor. But they will not tell him that they are ready to go to any kind of help. They are just saying that there is someone else out there who can do anything. They have told him that they will call his brother and sister and say that he is a man, that they know what he is talking about. But they have not told him that he is a person. They are just telling him that he is just a person. I think that is very much a mistake. It should not be. I feel very sorry for him. I also want to express my deep sorrow and sadness that he has found someone to talk to. I want to help him understand the pain he is in and that it is real and should not be allowed to happen. He may have had a lot of courage when he first started thinking about it, but it has taken him so much time to see that he is just one person.\n",
